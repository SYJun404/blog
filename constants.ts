		"My neighbor came into the house. I looked out the window. \n" +
		"After a few minutes, he and his wife came to call me and told me the WiFi wasn't working, that the password wasn't going in. \n" +

		"He held his hand and walked him to the garden. \n" +

		"I will water mine with clean water from the lake, but you will water yours with dirty water from the pond. \n" +

		"It took them some days to finally germinate the flower seeds. \n" +
		"They cared for them respectively and watched them. \n" +
		"Later on, the father brought his son to the garden and said to him, look at the two flowers and tell me your observation. \n" +
		"The boy responded, my flower looks better and healthier than yours. \n" +
		"How is that even possible when your water is clean? \n" +
		"The father smiled and said, that's because dirty water doesn't stop a plan from growing.\n" +
		"Rather, it serves as organic fertilizer to help it flourish. \n" +
		"You see, some there are some people who put you down in life, mock your dreams and throw dirt on you. \n" +

		"A young man asked his grandfather, grandpa, how did you live in the past, without technology, without computers, without drones, without bitcoins, without Internet connection, without tvs, without air conditioners, without cars, without mobile phones?\n" +
		"Grandpa answered, just as your generation lives today, no prayers, no compassion, no respect, no good manners and right conduct, no real education, poor personality. \n" +
		"There is no human kindness. There is no shame. There is no modesty. There is no honesty. \n" +
		"We, the people born between the years 1930 to 1980, were the blessed ones. \n" +
		"Our lives are a living proof. While playing and riding a bike, we have never worn a helmet. \n" +
		"After school, we did our homework ourselves, and we always played in meadows until sunset. \n" +
		"We played with real friends, not virtual friends. \n" +
		"If we were thirsty, we would drink from the fountain, from the waterfalls, faucet water, not mineral water. \n" +
		"We never worried and get sick, even as we shared the same cup or plate with our friends. \n" +
		"We never gained weight by eating bread and pasta every day. \n" +
		"Nothing happened to our feet despite walking barefoot. \n" +
		"We never used food supplements to stay healthy. \n" +
		"We used to make our own toys and play with them. \n" +
		"Our parents were not rich. They gave us love, not material gifts. \n" +
		"We never had a cell phone, dvd psp game console, x-box, video games, pc, laptop, internet chat. \n" +
		"But we had true friends. \n" +
		"We visited our friends without being invited, and shared and enjoyed the food with their family. \n" +
		"Parents live nearby to take advantage of family time. \n" +
		"We may have had black and white photos, but you can find colorful memories in these photos. \n" +
		"We are a unique and the most understanding generation, because we are the last generation that listen to their parents, and we are also the 1st ones who are forced to listen to their children. \n" +
		"We are limited edition, take advantage of us, learn from us. \n" +
